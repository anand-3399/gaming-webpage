# gaming-webpage
In this project, I have created a prototype of a gaming website using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I have included all the major attributes of HTML and used some of the advance CSS concepts like Gradient and Hower images. Certain attributes like inline block elements, display:block and othe things I have included so that it is looking very attractive.



Above is the link of my webpage. You can visit on any devices as it is a responsive website. It is compatible to all MacOS, WindowsOS, any mobile devices and even Tabs.
