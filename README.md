# gaming-webpage
In this project, I have created a prototype of a gaming website using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. I have included all the major attributes of HTML and used some of the advance CSS concepts like Gradient and Hower images. Certain attributes like inline block elements, display:block and othe things I have included so that it is looking very attractive.
